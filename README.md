BYI

- I LOVE talking to people in fandoms I'm in when I'm not on dniuf/dniuid/dni.
- If I'm on dniuf/dniuid/dni and I crown you, you CAN respond !!
- Beware, I don't know what to say in conversations a lot of times, so if it's awkward my apologies... </3
- If I make you uncomfortable please tell me !!
- If you send me a whisper and I don't respond, it's most likely because I'm offtab or afk, but I will respond eventually !!
- Yes, I enjoy Hazbin Hotel and Helluva Boss, but I DO NOT SUPPORT VIV.
- I'm very forgetful so if I forget your name, I apologize.
- Don't direct sexual jokes towards me, I AM A MINOR.
- I will most likely move to a different area if I feel left out, theres someone I don't like or don't wanna be around, I'm uncomfortable, or if I'm not in the mood to interact.
